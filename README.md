# MiniQuest
The ant game with a one-screen overworld/dungeon where you must find 4 items to fight four bosses in order to win the ant princess's heart!

## Updated Version

This code has been kept as-is, like a time capsule from 2012. To see a modern take on this project, see my HaxeFlixel version [here](https://github.com/AlejandorLazaro/MiniQuestHaxe)!

## Concept

This game was originally developed for [Ludum Jam #23](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/) with the Theme: __Tiny World__

Sadly—as tends to happen with many code projects—it was never completed. So now I'm looking to revive it again and use its code base to improve the game itself while also improving my JS code chops.

## Playing/Testing

Once you've downloaded the source, all you have to do is open the [index.html](./index.html) page and voila!
