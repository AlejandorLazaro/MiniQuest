# MiniQuest
The ant game with a one-screen overworld/dungeon where you must find 4 items to fight four bosses in order to win the ant princess's heart!

## Concept

This game was originally developed for [Ludum Jam #23](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/) with the Theme: __Tiny World__

Sadly—as tends to happen with many code projects—it was never completed. So now I'm looking to revive it again and use its code base to improve the game itself while also improving my JS code chops.

## Playing/Testing

Once you've downloaded the source, all you have to do is open the [index.html](./index.html) page and voila!
