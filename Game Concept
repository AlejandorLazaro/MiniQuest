GAME CONCEPT!

CRUNCH PLAN:
=========
Due to limited time, priorities for final crunch:
* game WILL allow:
- spawn at castle
- get sword
- kill bird
- conversation will be alert boxes only
- do not get distracted with other concepts


MiniQuest!
----------

The ant game with one overworld/dungeon where you must find 4 items to fight four bosses in order to win the ant princess's heart!


Ending:
-------

- "king" was insane asylum escapee- ants don't have kings!
- AMMENDED! The king is a real king. Don't forget it! [â€¦maybe :D]

After the fact todo:
------

- damage taking
- castle
- defeated enemy cleanup

- bow
- other bosses
- Dialog and Cut Scenes! :D
